# labnotebook
A jupyterhub system designed to allow reproducible research with docker-ized kernels; all in a docker container.

To Do:

- [ ] Persist user database in Volumes
- [ ] Volume vs bind mount for home directories? (Prob volume bc users won't have access on the native host)
- [ ] Volume vs bind mount for data sources
- [ ] Script for user setup on creation
- [ ] Upgrade Jupyterhub to 4.0
- [ ] Install and integrate matlab
- [ ] Test Dockernel
- [ ] SSL encryption
