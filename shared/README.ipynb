    "# README.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to `labnotebook`. This is a docker-ized JupyterHub deployment that is setup to allow notebook kernels to run in Docker containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "### How can I grant `admin` privliges to a different user?\n",
    "\n",
    "Admin privlidges consist of administration on the Hub, and `sudo` root access on the Docker system. Once the user account has been created (they must successfully log in after being Authorized by the `admin` user) then the `admin` user can choose File > Hub Control Panel > Admin > Edit User and then check the `admin` option. This will give that user the ability to authorize or decline new users to use the Hub.\n",
    "\n",
    "Separately, the `admin` user can grant sudo privliges to `anotheruser` in a terminal by running:\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo usermod -aG sudo anotheruser\n",
    "```\n",
    "In order to get this to work `anotheruser` will need to restart their server from the Hub Control Panel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How can I generate a PDF of a notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `jupyter nbconvert`. See [shared/samples/Exporting to PDF.ipynb](/hub/user-redirect/lab/tree/home/admin/shared/samples/Exporting%20to%20PDF.ipynb) for an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Is there a way to use version control?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, the excellent [jupyterlab-git](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git) extension is installed. To connect to a remote repository (eg. GitHub), you'll need to provide SSH keys. These are automatically generated for users at `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Can I use another user's kernel container image?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes! Each user manages which containers are installed as kernels for them, but the images are globally available. To install a kernel all you need is the name of the docker container, and run the `!dockernel install ...` cell of the kernel definition. For example this cell will install the container tagged as `tensorflow-2.13-gpu:latest` to the current user's kernelspec:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "!dockernel install tensorflow-2.13-gpu:latest \\\n",
    "    --name TensorFlow-2.13-GPU \\\n",
    "    -v labnotebook-homedirs:/home:rw \\\n",
    "    --gpus all \\\n",
    "    --network host \\\n",
    "    --user -1 \\\n",
    "    --group-add -1 \\\n",
    "    --language python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that since the image names are global, if you're modifying someone else's Dockerfile make sure you `docker build` with a different tag, or their kernel will start using your image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How should I monitor containers and images?\n",
    "\n",
    "Containers will stop automatically once the corresponding kernel is stopped. You can list images with:"
